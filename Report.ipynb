    "## Detailed Report\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Data Loading and Initial Exploration\n",
    "- The dataset was loaded using Pandas, and the first few rows were displayed to understand its structure.\n",
    "- Basic information about the dataset was printed using `data.info()`, which provided details on column types and non-null values.\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics were generated using `data.describe(include='all')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Handling Missing Values\n",
    "- The number of missing values in each column was checked using `data.isnull().sum()`.\n",
    "- The dataset had missing values, and appropriate methods were applied to handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Outlier Detection and Handling\n",
    "- A function `handle_outliers()` was defined to detect and replace outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.\n",
    "- Outliers in the 'Ontario_Demand' column and other numeric columns were replaced with their respective median values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Feature Engineering\n",
    "- The 'Date' column was converted to datetime format.\n",
    "- Additional time-based features were created: 'Year', 'Month', 'Day'.\n",
    "- Canadian holidays were considered to create a 'Holiday' feature, indicating whether a date is a holiday or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Feature Encoding\n",
    "- Categorical features, 'Weekday' was encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format.\n",
    "- This step ensures that the model can interpret categorical data correctly and leverage these features for better predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 Data Visualization\n",
    "- The distribution of the 'Ontario_Demand' column was visualized using a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Selection and Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Train-Test Split\n",
    "- The dataset was split into training and testing sets, ensuring that the model was evaluated on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Feature Selection\n",
    "- Feature importance was evaluated using RandomForestRegressor to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable.\n",
    "- Features with higher importance were prioritized, while less important features were considered for removal to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.1 RandomForestRegressor\n",
    "- A RandomForestRegressor was chosen as the model for predicting Ontario Demand.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.3.2 XGBoost\n",
    "- XGBoost, an advanced gradient boosting algorithm, was also considered due to its high performance and efficiency.\n",
    "- The parameter grid for XGBoost included variations in 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', 'learning_rate', 'subsample', and 'colsample_bytree'.\n",
    "- GridSearchCV was used with 3-fold cross-validation to evaluate different combinations of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Predictions\n",
    "- The best models from the grid search for both RandomForestRegressor and XGBoost were used to make predictions on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "- The following metrics were calculated to evaluate the models' performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### RandomForestRegressor\n",
    "  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 755.49\n",
    "  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 4.85%\n",
    "  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1125958.11\n",
    "  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1061.11\n",
    "  - R-squared (R²): 0.79\n",
    "  - Accuracy: 95.15%\n",
    "\n",
    "##### XGBoost\n",
    "  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 703.24\n",
    "  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 4.53%\n",
    "  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1067504.23\n",
    "  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1033.20\n",
    "  - R-squared (R²): 0.80\n",
    "  - Accuracy: 95.47%\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Visualization\n",
    "- A plot of actual vs predicted Ontario Demand was created to visually assess the models' performance for both RandomForestRegressor and XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Both RandomForestRegressor and XGBoost models, after hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, performed well on the test set with high accuracy and low error metrics. XGBoost slightly outperformed RandomForestRegressor, showing better evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- XGBoost is recommended for deployment due to its superior performance.\n",
    "- Further improvements could include trying other machine learning models and comparing their performance.\n",
    "- Time series-specific models, such as ARIMA or LSTM, could be explored for potentially better performance.\n",
    "- Feature engineering could be further enhanced by including additional relevant features that might impact the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions to Run the Project\n",
    "- Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/R7patel/datascientist-codechallenge.git\n",
    "- Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "- Run the Notebook: Open and run the Jupyter notebook ChallengeAccepted.ipynb.\n",
